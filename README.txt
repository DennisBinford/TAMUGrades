TAMUGrades allows for the searching of every section provided by the Office of the Registrar's PDF through robust filtering options
to help students hone in on what they want to search for in the 195,000 sections since 2012.

Below are bulleted action items I am currently working on:
- Making sure the API properly paginates, filters, and searches



Below are future features/ideas/bug fixes, if you have any you believe would be useful for the website please provide ideas:
- Create a react table that dynamically changes through filtering and sorting each column that exists in a section
- Add PDFs based on college sorting into the PDFs/Colleges folder
- BUG FIX: rare bug where the professor is not a name, seems only 3 exist in the current scraper
